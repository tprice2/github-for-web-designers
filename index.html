            <p><em>The 3D Printer Inc. was founded on January 1st, 2004. It began simply as a vision. Two college students, Mark Twain and Al Capone, had grown tired of having to constantly buy things. Finally, on a chilly winter morning, they both agreed to give up their wealth, forcing them to print everything they would need to survive. Though they quickly failed, an anonymous buyer was able to purchase the remainder of the company in August of 2008. Since then, 3D Printers Inc. has accelerated the world of additive manufacturing, transforming the industry into what it is today. At 3D Printers Inc., we have only one motto. <q>Buying things costs money, and leaving your house is lame</q> That is why we 3D print everything we can, even if it's unreasonable and impractical. With that in mind, enjoy our products, and please contact us if you have any questions!</em></p>
